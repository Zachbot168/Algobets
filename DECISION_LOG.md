# VALORANT Betting Platform - Decision Log

## Project Overview
✅ Objective: Build automated VALORANT betting system with ML predictions and Streamlit GUI
✅ Target: Match/map winners, total rounds, player props with Kelly criterion staking
✅ Data: Riot API, odds APIs, roster data with LLM enhancement

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Data Pipeline Architecture (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Storage**: DuckDB → S3 (Delta Lake) for cost-effective analytics workloads
- ✅ **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for reliable scheduling and dependency management  
- ✅ **API Design**: FastAPI for high-performance prediction service with async support
- ✅ **GUI Framework**: Streamlit for rapid development and easy deployment

### Technology Stack Decisions
- ✅ **ML Stack**: LightGBM primary, scikit-learn baseline, MLflow tracking
- ✅ **Data Ingestion**: aiohttp + httpx for async API calls, BeautifulSoup4 for scraping
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: pandas/polars for processing, featuretools for automation
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for local dev, targeting <$100/mo cloud cost

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Repository Scaffolding**: Complete Python package structure with proper module organization
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Bronze layer tables for matches, odds, teams, players, and patches
- ✅ **Airflow DAGs**: Full pipeline orchestration for ingestion, features, training, predictions
- ✅ **Docker Infrastructure**: Complete containerization with Compose setup

### Phase 2: Data & API Layer (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Data Ingestion**: Riot API, VLR.gg, TheOddsAPI, Pinnacle integration with rate limiting
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Comprehensive quality checks and error handling
- ✅ **FastAPI Service**: Complete prediction API with all endpoints and services
- ✅ **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs with full endpoint coverage

### Phase 3: User Interface (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Streamlit GUI**: Interactive dashboard with multiple pages and components
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Key metrics, upcoming matches, recommendations, bankroll management
- ✅ **Match Browser**: Upcoming/completed matches with filtering and detail views
- ✅ **Component System**: Reusable sidebar, header, and page components

### Phase 4: Documentation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Comprehensive README**: Installation, usage, architecture, and compliance guide
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Clear organization with proper Python packaging
- ✅ **Development Guide**: Testing, code quality, and contribution guidelines

## Remaining Work
- [ ] **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Elo calculations, rolling stats, market features
- [ ] **ML Model Training**: LightGBM models with MLflow integration and cross-validation
- [ ] **API Research**: Validate actual endpoints and rate limits for external APIs

## Technical Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Riot API rate limits → **Mitigation**: Multiple data sources + caching strategy
- **Risk**: Odds API costs → **Mitigation**: Start with free tiers, optimize polling frequency  
- **Risk**: Model drift → **Mitigation**: Automated retraining pipeline with performance monitoring

## Compliance Notes
- ✅ Focus on Illinois-legal sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetRivers, BetMGM)
- ✅ Defensive security only - no malicious betting automation
- ✅ Paper trading first to validate before real money deployment
